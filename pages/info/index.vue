      Hey, I've put together a little game to practice Vue/Nuxt.js with Buefy.
    </h1>
    <p>
      The objective of the watchtower game is to maintain home security by
      monitoring device status and battery levels. Players must strategically
      toggle device status between active and disabled to conserve battery while
      facing the threat of a thief attempting to infiltrate the house. You can
      select the difficulty of the game by setting how often the thief arrives;
      less frequently is, of course, easier. Quick reactions are key to
      preventing security breaches. Be cautious, as batteries below 10% take
      twice as long to charge!
